## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
From [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/): 
1. Write a "single" unit test describing an aspect of the program
2. Run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
3. Write "just enough" code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
4. Refactor the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
5. Repeat, accumulating unit tests over time
